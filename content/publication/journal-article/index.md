abstract: The unique combination of superb spatial resolution, wide-area
  coverage, and deep depth of the optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam
  (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program is utilized to search for dual quasar
  candidates. Using an automated image analysis routine on 34,476 known Sloan
  Digital Sky Survey quasars, we identify those with two (or more) distinct
  optical point sources in HSC images covering 796 deg2. We find 421 candidates
  out to a redshift of 4.5 of which one hundred or so are more likely after
  filtering out contaminating stars. Angular separations of 0"6-4"0 correspond
  to projected separations of 3-30 kpc, a range relatively unexplored for
  population studies of luminous dual quasars. Using Keck I/Low Resolution
  Imaging Spectrometer and Gemini-N/Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer,
  we spectroscopically confirm three dual quasar systems at z < 1, two of which
  are previously unknown out of eight observed, based on the presence of
  characteristic broad emission lines in each component, while highlighting that
  the continuum of one object in one of the pairs is reddened. In all cases, the
  [O III]λ5007 emission lines have mild velocity offsets, thus the joint [O III]
  line profile is not double-peaked. We find a dual quasar fraction of 0.26 ±
  0.18% and no evidence for evolution. A comparison with the Horizon-AGN
  simulation seems to support the case of no evolution in the dual quasar
  fraction when broadly matching the quasar selection. These results may
  indicate a scenario in which the frequency of the simultaneous triggering of
  luminous quasars is not as sensitive as expected to the cosmic evolution of
  the merger rate or gas content of galaxies.
