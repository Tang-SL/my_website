abstract: We report on a spectroscopic program to search for dual quasars using
  Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images of SDSS quasars, which represent an
  important stage during galaxy mergers. Using Subaru/FOCAS and Gemini-N/GMOS,
  we identify three new physically associated quasar pairs having projected
  separations less than 20 kpc, out of 26 observed candidates. These include the
  discovery of the highest-redshift (z = 3.1) quasar pair with a separation <10
  kpc. Based on the sample acquired to date, the success rate of identifying
  physically associated dual quasars is 19% when excluding stars based on their
  HSC colors. Using the full sample of six spectroscopically confirmed dual
  quasars, including three previously published, we find that the black holes in
  these systems have black hole masses (MBH ∼ 108−9M⊙), bolometric luminosities
  (log Lbol ∼ 44.5–47.5 erg s–1) and Eddington ratios (0.01–0.3) similar to
  single SDSS quasars. We measure the stellar mass of their host galaxies based
  on 2D image decomposition of the five-band (grizy) optical emission and assess
  the mass relation between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their hosts.
  Dual SMBHs appear to have elevated masses relative to their host galaxies.
  Thus, mergers may not necessarily align such systems onto the local mass
  relation, as suggested by the Horizon-AGN simulation. This study suggests that
  dual luminous quasars are triggered by mergers prior to the final coalescence
  of the two SMBHs, resulting in early mass growth of the black holes relative
  to their host galaxies.

  caption: Comparison of our dual quasar samples with single quasars and the local
    BH-host correlation. The thick black line and grey shading are the same as
    that in figure 12. 3,315 single quasars are selected from SDSS DR14 (details
    in Li et al. (2021)), with BH mass taken from Rakshit et al. (2020), and
    host mass calculated in the same way with de- composition and SED fitting.
    Our dual quasars are plotted with the dots representing the two BHs
    separately, and the star symbols are the sum of the dots, mimicking the
    final state of the merger. ted
