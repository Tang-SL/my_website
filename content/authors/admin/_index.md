I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student majoring in observational astrophysics. My main research interest is in the co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies, the formation and evolution of the galaxies over cosmic time, and the nature of quasars.

I﻿n particular, I have been searching for binary quasars with separations between 0.6" and 4" (<20 kpc/h) in Subaru HSC/SSP footprint, which is a special phase in the lifetime of galaxy merger that allows us to estimate the BH mass of both systems. In another project, I estimated the morphological asymmetry index of the host galaxies of type 1 quasars and studied its correlation with the physical properties of the SMBHs.
